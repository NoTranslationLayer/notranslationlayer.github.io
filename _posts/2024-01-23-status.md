We're thrilled to announce that Reflect has been accepted to the Apple App Store. It can be found [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6463800032?pt=126584930&ct=Debut&mt=8).

With this release comes a handful of features that are incredibly useful:

## Insights

Recording everything is great. Learning from that data is icing on the cake and the **Insights** feature takes the first step towards this goal. It currently calculates correlation scores between all metrics. Correlations provide a really useful signal when considering which of our metrics might be related.

Correlations can be evaluated between two specific metrics or between one metric and the rest. For example, here is an example relationship between fatigue and drive:

This view of correlations shows how fatigue measured on one day relates to the drive measured the day after, the drive measured on the same day, or the drive measured on the day before. It's apparent that fatigue and drive are moderately negatively correlated on the same day; in other words, there tends to be less drive on days when there is more fatigue. While not necessarily illustrative of a real causal relationship, this helps raise important questions and provides a starting point for further investigation.

[Reflect](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6463800032?pt=126584930&ct=Debut&mt=8) also supports displaying the top correlations for each metric. Here are the top same-day correlations for being in a **Playful** mood:

In this view of correlations, the other metrics are sorted by strongest correlation. This is a convenient feature for helping users discover relationships between metrics that they may not have considered before.

## CSV Import

So many in the quantified self community have created their own tools for tracking and analyzing data, backed by a store of data like a set of CSV files. Additionally, apps don't always offer an API to integrate into home brewed solutions (see why Reflect does not offer an API [here](/reflect/faq#no-api)); CSV export is sometimes the only option. Reflect's CSV importer tool was created to assist in migrating this data into the app. [Here](/reflect/tutorials/csv-import) is a tutorial for how to use it.
