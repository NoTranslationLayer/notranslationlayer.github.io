title:  Reflect Status Update - January 2024
---

We're thrilled to announce that Reflect has been accepted to the Apple App Store. You can find it [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reflect-track-anything/id6463800032).

With this release comes a handful of features that we're really excited about:

## Insights

We don't only want to record our data, we want to learn from it to. As a first step, we've implemented an Insights feature. It currently calculates correlation scores between all of your metrics. We've found that correlations provide a really useful signal when considering which of our metrics might be related.

Correlations can be evaluated between two specific metrics or between one metric and all of your metrics. For example, we can see the relationship between fatigue and drive:

![correlations-pairwise](/assets/correlations/pairwise-correlations.png)

This view of correlations shows how the fatigue we measure on one day is related to the drive we measure the day after, the drive we measured on the same day, or the drive we measured on the day before. Here we can see that fatigue and drive are moderately negatively correlated on the same day. In other words, there tends to be less drive on days when there is more fatigue. While not necessarily illustrative of a real causal relationship, this helps raise important questions and provides a starting point for further investigation.

We can also see what the top same-day correlations are to being in a playful mood:

In this view of correlations, the other metrics are sorted by strongest correlation. This is a convenient feature for helping users discover relationships between metrics that they may not have considered before.

## CSV Import

So many of us in the quantified self community have created our own tools for tracking and analyzing our data. Often, our favorite apps don't offer an API to integrate into our home brewed solutions, and we're left with exports from various services. Much of the time, we end up with this data in CSV form.

To help get our data into Reflect, we built a CSV importer tool. You can find a tutorial for how to use it [here](/reflect/tutorials/csv-import.markdown).
