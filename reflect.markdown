[Reflect](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6463800032?pt=126584930&ct=Debut&mt=8) allows you to track anything and gain insights from your data.

Whether it's your mood, symptoms, activities, events, performance, supplements, habits, or weight, Reflect offers you a high level of control to record anything you wish. Here are some of its features:

### Free unlimited custom tracking

Unlike other apps, recording your data with Reflect is completely free; you can track as much as you'd like and you are only limited by your imagination.

### Visualization

See trends in your data and identify relationships between metrics.

### Insights

Learn which metrics correspond most highly with anything you track. Answer questions like "am I more productive on days I wake up earlier?" or "how does spending time outside relate to my ability to concentrate?". Read more about correlations and insights in our [January 2024 Update](/blog/2024-01-23).

### Get started immediately

There is no "signing up" step; just specify what your data looks like and begin recording.

### Extreme privacy

All data storage and analysis are performed locally on your device, we do not have access to your data.

### Extreme flexibility

Reflect lets you construct forms that are specifically tailored to your needs. There are no limitations such as tracking only once per day, or having only a few things to choose from.

### Free CSV import

Migrate to Reflect by importing  your CSV data with ease with Reflect's template builder, enabling you to reap the benefits of Reflect's visualizations and insights immediately. [Here](/reflect/tutorials/csv-import) is a tutorial for how to use it.

### Free exporting

There is no lock-in to Reflect. Users are free to leave at any time; we want the qualities of the app to speak for themselves and serve the parts of you that want quality and control.
