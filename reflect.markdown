[Reflect](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6463800032?pt=126584930&ct=Debut&mt=8) allows you to track anything and gain insights from your data.

Whether it's your mood, symptoms, activities, events, performance, supplements, habits, or weight, Reflect offers you a high level of control to record anything you wish.

### Insights

Learn which metrics correspond most highly with anything you track. Answer questions like "Am I more productive on days I wake up earlier?" or "How does spending time outside relate to my ability to concentrate?"

### Get Started Immediately

There is no "signing up" step; just specify what your data looks like and begin recording.

### Extreme Privacy

All data storage and analysis are performed locally on your device. We do not have access to your data.

### Extreme Flexibility

Reflect lets you construct forms that are specifically tailored to your needs. There are no limitations such as tracking only once per day, or having only a few things to choose from.

Reflect supports various types of metrics including:
- **Numbers:** for quantitative data such as hours of sleep, cups of coffee, etc.
- **Strings/Text:** for qualitative data like mood, type of activity, etc.
- **Ratings:** for providing ratings on a scale with custom bounds, for example, stress level from 1 to 10.
- **Number With Units:** for tracking quantities with specific units like milligrams of a supplement.
- **Choices:** for mutually exclusive options, like if you worked from home, in the office, or from a friend's place.
- **Timers:** for measuring duration of an activity, like meditation or exercise.
