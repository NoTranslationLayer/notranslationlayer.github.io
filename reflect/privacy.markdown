## Commitment to Privacy

NTL values privacy and takes the stance that data you generate using Reflect is absolutely yours and does not belong to NTL.

## We Do Not Collect or Share Your Personal Data

NTL does not collect the data you record with Reflect. All data recorded with Reflect remains local to your device and never leaves your device, unless you choose to export your data outside of Reflect. Any analyses of your data are conducted locally on your device.

No personal data shared with NTL will be given to any third party, under any circumstances. Your data will also never be used by NTL for any purpose without specific and explicit permission.

NTL and Reflect do not engage in ad targeting, data mining, or other activities that may compromise your privacy, and we do not affiliate ourselves with any third parties that do so.

## Optional Anonymous Feedback

Reflect may make optional and anonymous surveys and feedback forms available. This helps us become aware of bugs and what our user base enjoys or wants us to change. When you submit this feedback to us, we retain it for our records to inform our development of Reflect. Any interface that allows you to send us information will be clearly marked as optional and anonymous.
