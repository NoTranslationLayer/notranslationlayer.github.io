#### How do I edit a **Reflection**?

To edit a reflection immediately after you have submitted the Reflection form, you can re-open the Reflection form from the **Reflect** tab. There is a link to the latest Reflection at the top of the Reflection form saying **Edit your reflection from MM/DD HH:mm**. Follow the link, make any desired changes, and then press ![checkmark.circle](/assets/icons/checkmark.circle.png) to save your changes.

**Note:** If the Reflection is configured as daily, the **Reflect** tab will take you straight to editing if you have already submitted it that day.

If you want to edit a Reflection from further in the past, go to the **History** tab, find the Reflection you want to edit, make any desired changes, and then press ![checkmark.circle](/assets/icons/checkmark.circle.png) to save your changes.

<a id="delete-reflection"></a>
#### How do I delete a **Reflection**?

Go to the **History** tab and open the history in list mode (the ![calendar](/assets/icons/calendar.png) / ![list.bullet](/assets/icons/list.bullet.png) icon in the top right allows you to switch between calendar and list mode). Swipe left and click on the red ![trash](/assets/icons/trash.png) icon to delete the Reflection.

If you want to delete the entire history for a given Reflection, not just one occurrence, click on the orange ![trash.slash](/assets/icons/trash.slash.png) icon.

<a id="edit-template"></a>
#### How do I edit a **Reflection Template**?

To edit a Reflection Template, swipe right on the Reflection name on the **Reflect** tab and press ![pencil](/assets/icons/pencil.png). From there, you can add or remove metrics, change the Reflection Template settings or notifications, then press ![checkmark.circle](/assets/icons/checkmark.circle.png) to save your changes.

See the [Creating Reflection Templates](/reflect/tutorials/creating-reflections) tutorial for further details on editing Reflection Templates.

<a id="view-history"></a>
#### How do I view the history for a specific **Reflection** type?

Go to the **History** tab and open the history in calendar mode (the ![calendar](/assets/icons/calendar.png) / ![list.bullet](/assets/icons/list.bullet.png) icon in the top right allows you to switch between calendar and list mode). Select the Reflection name in the **Display** dropdown menu below the calendar grid. This will filter the displayed Reflections in the calendar to that Reflection type.

<a id="custom-date-time"></a>
#### How do I specify a custom date/time of recording when I submit a **Reflection**?

In the Reflection form, click ![calendar](/assets/icons/calendar.png)
 at the top of the form and choose the desired date and time for the Reflection. 

You can also retroactively change the recording date/time by following the above step when editing a Reflection from your history.

<a id="add-notification"></a>
#### How do I add a notification?

To add a global notification reminder, press ![gear](/assets/icons/gear.png) in the top right on the **Reflect** tab and enable the **Daily Notification** setting. You can select the notification time by pressing on the displayed notification time.

To add a Reflection specific notification, press ![list.bullet](/assets/icons/list.bullet.png) **Add Notification** when editing the Reflection Template.

<a id="plot-values"></a>
#### How do I plot the values of a metric over time?

Go to the **Trends** tab. Press on one of the existings plots in the list of saved plots, or press ![plus.circle.fill](/assets/icons/plus.circle.fill.png) **New Plot** and choose a name for the plot if you would like to create a new plot.

Once in the desired plot page, press ![plus.circle.fill](/assets/icons/plus.circle.fill.png) in the top right corner to select the list of metrics you would like to display on the plot. Pressing ![arrow.counterclockwise](/assets/icons/arrow.counterclockwise.png) will clear all metrics from the plot if you want to remove all displayed metrics instead of individually de-selecting them.

To control various settings for data display and trend lines, press ![gearshape](/assets/icons/gearshape.png) to edit the plot options.

<a id="import-data"></a>
#### How do I import historical data from elsewhere?

See the [Importing from CSV](/reflect/tutorials/csv-import) tutorial.

<a id="no-api"></a>
#### Why doesn't Reflect offer an API?

Offering an API would require us to have servers that house and serve your data. Our [policy](/reflect/privacy) is to not collect your data for any purpose.

<a id="integration"></a>
#### How do I link to apps for my wearable devices and import my data?

See this [tutorial](/reflect/tutorials/add-integration). Currently, we only support integration with **Oura**. We plan to support more in the future.
