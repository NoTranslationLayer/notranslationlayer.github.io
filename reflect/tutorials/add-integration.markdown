Integrations are sources of data whose metrics are automatically fetched and incorporated into **Reflect**. You may correlate this data with anything you track. For example, you can correlate your **Activity Score** from **Oura** to an aspect of your mood, like your **Motivation**. Here are the steps to add your integration.


## Manage Integrations

Click the ![](/assets/icons/link.png) icon at the top right of the **Reflect** page to manage your integrations. If you haven't created any reflection forms, it will appear on the **Reflect** page itself.

<img src="/assets/reflect/integrations/main-page2.png" style="width: 45%; height: 45%; display: inline; padding: 10px; padding-bottom: 30px">

## Choose an Integration

 Click the name of the source you'd like to integrate with.

## Sign In

Sign into your account. The app you are trying to integrate with may ask you for permissions. As a reminder, **Reflect's** Privacy Policy may be found [here](/reflect/privacy).

## Import Historical Data

After signing into your account and choosing permissions, you can select the earliest date to sync data from. If you've been using a wearable since 2023 but only want to sync your data from 2024, you'll be able to specify it here. Don't worry, you can always go back and sync earlier historical data.

<img src="/assets/reflect/integrations/integration-page-active.png" style="width: 45%; height: 45%; display: inline; padding: 10px; padding-bottom: 30px">

After you choose this date, **Reflect** will import historical data that you can view in the **History** page. That data will now be available for plotting and insights.

Now that the integration has been linked, **Reflect** will periodically query it to keep your metrics up to date.
